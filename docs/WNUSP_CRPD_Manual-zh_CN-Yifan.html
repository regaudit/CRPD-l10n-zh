Our biggest victory – a paradigm shift away from a model based on paternalism to one based on respect for our human rights – is in the text of Article 12 on legal capacity.  States have to recognize that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others.  What does this mean?  We understand legal capacity in the sense of capacity to act, which is both the right to make decisions, and a legal status equal with other adults in one's society.  Deciding whether to accept medical treatment or go into a hospital is an exercise of legal capacity.  If someone else, whether a doctor, court, or imposed guardian, is authorized by law to substitute their will for your own, this deprives you of the right to exercise legal capacity on an equal basis with others.  Mental health commitment laws violate Article 12.  In addition, the whole system of guardianship violates Article 12.  Sometimes people are put under guardianship and the guardian can put them into a psychiatric institution and consent on their behalf to forced ECT and drugs.  Instead of a guardian, the person should be offered support if he or she chooses it; and the support has to respect his or her will and preferences (from Article 12.4).  </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
我们最大的胜利——从一个基于家长式的模型向基于尊重我们的人权的范式转型——在第12条的关于法律能力的文本中。国家必须承认残障人享有与别人同等基础上的法律能力。这意味着什么呢？从行动的能力的意义而言，我们知道法律能力，就是指做决定的权利，以及与社会的其他成年人平等的法律地位。决定是否接受医学治疗或者住院是对法律能力的行使。如果其他某一个人，不管是他是医生、法庭、或者被指定的监护人，被法律授权去以他们的意愿来代替你的，这就剥夺了你在与其他人平等基础上行使法律能力的权利。精神健康收治法律侵犯了第12条。有时候人们置于监护关系下，而监护人可以把他们放进精神病治疗机构并且代替他们同意强迫的电击治疗和药物治疗。如果他或她选择使用治疗时，应该提供支持，而不是提供监护人；而该支持应该尊重他或她的意愿和偏好。</td>

An international team of users and survivors of psychiatry, led by Tina Minkowitz, participated actively in the negotiations at the United Nations (UN) in New York from the first session of the Ad Hoc Committee in August 2002 through the adoption of the completed text on December 13, 2006.  The Ad Hoc Committee was a unique process for all of us.  We seized a historic opportunity and accomplished something basic and fundamental that has changed the human rights landscape for us and for all people with disabilities.  Many of us made lasting friendships with each other and with other people with disabilities and allies, from around the world.  Working together closely, over the course of several years, in person at the UN and by email discussions, we brought user/survivor issues into the heart of the disability movement and found a rich common ground, especially on the issue of legal capacity, which is the ultimate test of the guarantee of full and equal enjoyment of human rights.  </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
一支由Tina Minkowitz领导的国际性的精神医学使用者和幸存者队伍，积极参与了位于纽约的联合国从2002年8月的特设委员会的第一次会议，直至到2006年12月13日采用完成的文本的全过程的协商当中。特设委员会对于我们来说是一个独特的经历。我们抓住了一个历史性的机会并且实现了某种基本且重要的事情，这件事情已经改变我们全部人和所有残障人的人权形势。我们许多人互相缔结了持续的友谊，也与其他残障人和全世界的同盟者们结下了友谊。一起紧密的工作，在过去几年的过程中，亲身在联合国和通过电子邮件来讨论，我们把使用者/幸存者问题带到残障运动的中心，并且形成了丰富的共同话语基础，特别在法律能力的问题上，也是对充分和平等享有人权的保证的最重要的考验。</td>

Users and survivors from the World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry (WNUSP), MindFreedom/Support Coalition International (MF/SCI) and other organizations came to the UN from  Canada,  Denmark,  Ghana,  Guinea,  Hungary,  Ireland,  India,  Japan,  New Zealand,  Nicaragua,  Peru,  Sweden,  Uganda,  the United Kingdom,  and the United States of America.  WNUSP members served on New Zealand’s and Sweden’s government delegations.  We were an impressive force.  WNUSP helped to create the International Disability Caucus (IDC) and participated actively in its governance through our seat on the steering committee.  The IDC had a principle of respecting the leadership of disabled people’s organizations (DPOs), and respecting any particular DPO on matters relating to its constituency.  In addition, we agreed that the Convention should “be equally relevant to all persons with disabilities, irrespective of the type of disability or geographical location”.  This helped to ensure solidarity. </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
来自WNUSP的使用者和幸存者，「自由思想」/「支持联盟国际」和其他来自加拿大、丹麦、加纳、几内亚、匈牙利、爱尔兰、印度、日本、新西兰、尼加拉瓜、秘鲁、瑞典、乌干达、英国和美国的组织来到联合国。WNUSP成员在新西兰和瑞典的政府的代表团任职。我们是一股引人注目的力量。WNUSP帮助创建国际残障核心小组（IDC）和通过我们在筹划指导委员会的席位积极参与到它的管理中来。IDC有一个原则，就是尊重残障人自组织（DPOs）的领导权，并且在与它的支持者相关的事情上，尊重任何特定的残障人组织。而且，我们同意公约应该“平等地对所有残障人相关的，不考虑残障的类型或者是地理位置”。这有助于确保团结。</td>

WNUSP contributed several position papers of our own, including proposed text for the treaty, much of which was accepted.  When the IDC began working together to present a unified position, we authored and/or coordinated the work of the IDC on some important articles, including Article 12 on legal capacity, Article 14 on liberty, Article 15 on torture, Article 17 on integrity of the person, Article 22 on privacy, Article 23 on home and family, Article 27 on employment, Article 29 on political participation, and part of Article 25 on health.  An important aspect of our work was building alliances, building consensus, and learning to collaborate with other disability rights activists.   Finally the IDC spoke with one coherent and powerful voice to promote a human rights agenda for all persons with disabilities.    </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
WNUSP贡献了我们自己的几项建议书，包括协议的提议文本，大部分被接纳了。当国际残障核心小组开始一起工作去提出一个统一的立场，在某些重要条款上，我们撰写和/或者协调IDC的工作，包括关于法律能力的第12条，关于人身自由的第14条，关于酷刑的第15条，关于人的整合性的17条，关于隐私的第22条，关于住房和家庭的第23条，关于就业的第27条，关于政治参与的第29条，和关于康复的第25条的部分文本。我们工作的的一项重要方面是建立同盟，建立共识，和学习怎样与其他残障权利积极份子进行合作。最终国际残障核心小组发出一致和强有力的声音，来促进所有残障人的人权进程。</td>

WNUSP involvement started even before the first Ad Hoc Committee meeting, when we learned of a meeting being held in Mexico City in June 2002 to bring together experts to discuss the Convention.  WNUSP requested and received an invitation, and submitted a paper that set out the main tenets of our advocacy as well as commenting on the draft text that the Mexican government had prepared.  The meeting successfully established our role in the community of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and our advocacy was made part of a paper agreed to by the NGOs at the meeting.</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
WNUSP的参与到公约当中，最早甚至要追朔到当我们得知2002年6月在墨西哥城举行的一次会议，那次会议是聚集专家讨论公约，这是在参加第一次特设委员会会议之前就已经开始的了。WNUSP请求并接受了邀请，并且提交了一份文件，不但提出了我们倡导的基本原则，也对墨西哥政府准备的起草文本表述意见。该会议成功地建立我们在非政府组织共同体中的地位，并且我们的倡议在会议上被非政府组织接受成为文件的一部分。</td>

The first Ad Hoc Committee meeting established an agreement to continue the process of “considering proposals for a Convention,” and the second (in June 2003) agreed to set up a working group to produce a draft text for negotiation, drawing on proposals submitted by governments and civil society (including WNUSP).  Tina Minkowitz represented WNUSP as one of 12 NGOs that participated in the working group, along with 27 governments and one national human rights institution.  In this group, which convened in January 2004, all participants had an equal voice and collaborated to produce the resulting text.  Users and survivors of psychiatry finally had a seat at the table and spoke with a passion and clarity that was heard around the world.  </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
第一次特设委员会会议建立了一个能够继续把“考虑对公约的建议”的过程进行下去的协议，并且在第二次（2003年6月）同意建立一个工作组来产生一个用于协商的草拟文本，利用政府和民间社会（包括WNUSP）提交的建议。与27个政府组织和国家人权机构一起，Tina Minkowitz代表WNUSP作为12个非政府组织之一，参与到工作组当中。在这个工作组中，我们2004年1月举行会议，所有参与方能够发出平等的声音，并且互相合作，产生最终的文本。精神医学使用者和幸存者终于坐在桌旁，并且发出热情和清晰的能让全世界听到的声音。</td>

Then it was time for negotiation, when all governments and civil society organizations (including those that had not participated in the working group) had the opportunity first to improve the text, and then to settle on a final version that everyone could live with.  It was not an easy process, and attempts were also made to weaken the text.  However, the IDC’s approval was sought and wanted, since we represented the constituency that is supposed to benefit from the Convention.  This was important for WNUSP in securing recognition of equal legal capacity, liberty on an equal basis, free and informed consent and right to respect for integrity of the person, all without the limitations that had previously been inserted into documents dealing with the rights of users and survivors of psychiatry.  WNUSP and MF/SCI participated in several side events during the Ad Hoc Committee meetings primarily focusing on the importance of recognition of legal capacity on an equal basis with others and of the freedom to make our own decisions.  We worked hard and lobbied hard, and had to listen to a lot of disrespectful opinions.  In the last stages of the process we had to deal with a betrayal of our interests in a political process, when a footnote was inserted limiting the meaning of legal capacity in Arabic, Chinese and Russian to “capacity for rights” and not “capacity to act”.  But we were able to turn this around, with the help of our IDC allies and many governments who did not accept the footnote, and removing the footnote was the victory that capped our experience.  </td>

然后，当所有政府和公民社会组织（包括那些没有参加到工作小组来的组织）有机会首先改进文本，是时候进行协商了，然后决定每个人都能够接受的最终版本。这不是一个容易的过程，并且也有削弱文本的意图。然而，需要寻求和得到国际残障核心小组的同意，因为我们代表着的应该从公约中受益的拥护者们。在获得平等法律能力的承认、在平等基础上的自由、自由和知情同意权和尊重身心完整性的权利方面，这对于WNUSP非常重要，完全没有如以前那样精神医学使用者和幸存者的权利是被插入到相关方面文件的窘境。在特设委员会会议最早的关注是确认与其他人平等基础上的法律能力方面，以及我们能够自主做决定的方面。WNUSP和MF/SCI参加进来了。 我们努力工作，并且努力游说，并且要聆听很多不尊重我们的意见。在那个过程的最后阶段，当在阿拉伯世界、中国和俄罗斯的翻译版本里，一个补充说明被添加去限制法律能力的含义，说成“权利的能力”，而不是“行动的能力”的时候，我们必须去应付在这个政治过程中有人对我们利益的背叛。但在国际残障小组同盟和很多不接受补充说明的政府的帮助下，我们能够把这个扭转过来，而且删除补充说明（这件事）是一次超过我们的经验的胜利。</td>

The Convention was open for signing on March 30, 2007 and it was signed by almost half of the UN member states on the opening day, indicating their intent to ratify (become legally bound by the Convention).  It is now the task of the world community to bring the ideals that are laid out in the Convention into reality. </td>

公约在2007年3月30日开放给成员国签署，在当日有大概一半联合国成员国签署了该公约，表明了他们在本国批准的意愿（即在法律上受公约制约）。现在使公约中的理想变成现实也是国际社会的重要任务。</td>

Users and survivors have the opportunity to work with their government, through a national consultation process, on implementing the Convention, and also incorporate the Convention into advocacy they are doing (for instance, to get people out of institutions or stop forced drugging or electroshock).  The Convention is a rich document and people may choose to focus on one or another area, depending on circumstances and priorities.  </td>

We have highlighted the aspects of the Convention that address the human rights violations especially targeted against users and survivors of psychiatry, in the areas of legal capacity, liberty and right to live in the community, freedom from forced psychiatric interventions, our inclusion as people with disabilities and participation in enforcement mechanisms.  These are the areas that we believe will make a difference in the lives of all users and survivors of psychiatry, and without which other guarantees, such as the right to work and the right to vote, are meaningless to us.</td>

Users and survivors of psychiatry are urged to read this manual together with the text of the Convention, and to apply it creatively to situations they are facing.  Besides guaranteeing specific rights, the Convention requires equality and non-discrimination in the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  If the Convention and this manual do not address a particular situation, users and survivors can find the articles that seem most relevant and make their best argument.  Human rights lawyers can help, but may also need to be educated by the user/survivor movement to present our issues correctly.  </td>

精神医学使用者和幸存者被鼓励去一并读公约和本手册，并且创造性地运用到他们面对的情境中去。除了保证特定的权利之外，公约在所有人权和基本自由的基础上要求平等和非歧视。如果公约和本手册没有提出某项特别情形，使用者和幸存者可以寻找看起来与他们最相关的条例，并且找到他们最好的论点。人权律师可以提供帮助，但是也需要由使用者/幸存者来教育他们如何正确地展现我们的议题。</td>

We face challenges in implementing the Convention, since there is as yet no government that complies with its requirements in relation to users and survivors of psychiatry.  Many governments will contest the obligations in the Convention and fight to keep their guardianship and mental health laws, to continue psychiatric detention and violence, and promote a deficit-based view of psychosocial disability requiring medical model “treatments”.  They will try to find loopholes or interpret it to make exceptions for the obligations they would rather not comply with.  However, we have had many victories in the process of creating the Convention, and there are encouraging signs that our message has been heard by some governments, and that our allies in the disability and human rights communities will continue to work with us at the international and national levels.  The challenges we face are not unique to our situation but are the same challenges faced by any group of disenfranchised people claiming our human rights as recognized in an international treaty.  Our movement has matured a great deal through the treaty process and will continue to meet the challenges to break through to real change in the lives of users and survivors of psychiatry everywhere.  </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
我们在实施公约时面临挑战，因为到现在为止，还有没有政府遵从与精神医学使用者和幸存者有关的要求。许多政府会与公约里的责任辩驳，并且为保留他们的监护人制度和精神卫生法律战斗，来继续精神病拘留和暴力，并且推进一个“基于缺陷”的社会心理残障的观点，该观点要求进行医学模式的“治疗”。他们会设法寻找漏洞，或者刻意解读出例外的情况以便可以不履行义务。然而，我们在创造公约的过程中有过许多胜利，并且有鼓舞人心的迹象显示我们的主张已经被一些政府听到，并且我们在残障和人权社会团体的同盟将会继续在国际和国家的层面与我们并肩工作。我们面临的挑战并不只是我们独有的，而且任何主张国际条约所承认的人权的被剥夺自由权的社群也同样面临这样的挑战。我们的行动已经在条约形成过程中成熟了许多，并且会继续迎接挑战，让在每个地方的精神病学使用者和幸存者的生活有真正改变。</td>

<td class='src'  lang='en'>
A: The concept of legal capacity has been used to deny personhood and to disqualify users and survivors from managing our own lives. Art 12 of the CRPD has dismantled these deprivations by conferring personhood to all persons with disabilities and by recognizing that we have the legal capacity to run our own lives.  Also if we so desire, we can seek support to exercise our legal capacity. Thus support is no longer inflicted upon us whether we want I it or not, rather it is assistance which has to be made available if we wish to use it.  </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
A：法律能力这个概念曾经被用作否认人格和剥夺使用者和幸存者管理我们自己的生活的资格。公约的第12条已经向所有残障人赋予人格和承认我们拥有管理我们生活的法律能力，并消除这些对残障人权利的剥夺。同样如果我们要求，我们可以寻求支持来行使我们的法律能力。这样，无论我们是否需要，支持都不再是强加于我们的，而是当我们希望行使法律能力的时候，必须提供给我们的协助。</td>

A: Article 17 grants to all persons with disabilities the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others.  It is this right which protects persons who do not have disabilities from unwelcome treatment, forcible confinement or any other unwelcome invasion of their body and mind.  Article 17, by its guarantee of equality and non discrimination, also makes these available to us.  This guarantee is further strengthened by the fact that article 25 obliges health care professionals to provide treatment only on the basis of free and informed consent.  Free and informed consent can only be given by the person concerned, and not by family members, courts or others.  (This follows from the guarantee of legal capacity).  In addition under article 15 the Convention protects the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which includes medical or scientific experimentation without consent.  The cumulative effect of these provisions is to oust forced psychiatry.   </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
A：第17条授予所有残障人赋有在与其他人平等基础上的、获得他人尊重他们的身心完整性的权利。这项权利保护那些没有残障的人士免于不受欢迎的治疗、强制性的监禁或者任何其他不受欢迎的对他们身心的侵害。第17条，通过它对平等性和非歧视的保证，也使我们可以获得这些权利。第25条强制卫生保健专业人士只有基于自由和知情同意下才能提供治疗——这已经是个事实，令这保证更进一步得到加强。自由和知情同意只能够由本人给出，不是由家人、法院或其他人给出。（这是以对残障人士法律能力的保证为前提）。另外，公约第15条规定保护残障人免于酷刑和残忍、不人道或者有辱人格的待遇或者惩罚的权利，这些没有被同意的待遇和惩罚包括医疗和科学试验。这些条款的累积效果就是要废除强制精神医疗。</td>

A: Persons with disabilities have the right to liberty on an equal basis with others, and deprivation of liberty cannot be justified on the basis of disability.  People with disabilities also have the right to live in the community, and to choose where and with whom to live, on an equal basis with others (and legal capacity ensures that each person can exercise this right directly and not have a guardian or family member substitute their decision).  Forced institutionalization or hospitalization on the basis of disability is therefore prohibited.  </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
答：残障人拥有在与其他人平等基础上的自由权利，而且基于残障的对自由的剥夺是没有正当理由的。并且在与他人平等的基础上，残障人士也有居住在社区的权利，并且选择住在哪里和与谁同住 (法律能力确保每个人能够直接地行使此项权利并且不用由监护人或者家人代替他们的决定)。因此基于残障的强制性机构化或者住院是被禁止的。</td>

A: An international monitoring committee will be set up to receive reports from governments and make recommendations; the international committee can also receive complaints from individuals whose rights have been violated, but only if the government has ratified the Optional Protocol along with the Convention.

During the negotiations, it was impossible for the parties to agree on a definition of disability that included all persons with disabilities and excluded no person with a disability.  The Preamble of the Convention in subparagraph (e) recognizes “that disability is an evolving concept.”  Article 1 of the Convention states that, “The purpose of the present Convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.  Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.”</td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
在协商过程中，要参与各方在残障的定义（即所有人都是残障人，没有人不是残障人）达成一致是不可能的。公约的序言承认“残障是一个不断演变的概念”。公约第一条说：“现有的公约的目标是促进、保护和确保所有残障人充分和平等享有所有人权和基本自由，并且提升对他们固有的尊严的尊重。残障人包括那些有长期身体、精神、智力或者感官的损伤而导致他们在与各种障碍互动时可能会阻碍（在与其他人平等基础上）充分和有效参与到社会活动的人士。</td>

During the course of the negotiations, WNUSP developed language to refer to persons with psychiatric disabilities that moved away from the medical model of individual pathology.  We described ourselves as persons with psychosocial disabilities.  The word psychosocial refers to the interaction between psychological and social/cultural components of our disability.  The psychological component refers to ways of thinking and processing our experiences and our perception of the world around us.  The social/cultural component refers to societal and cultural limits for behavior that interact with those psychological differences/madness as well as the stigma that the society attaches to labeling us as disabled. </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
在协商的过程中，WNUSP发展了一套话语来把「精神残疾人」（这个词）从医学模式的个人病理学中拽了出来。我们改描述自己为「社会心理残障人士」。「社会心理」一词指我们的残障在心理和社会/文化因素之间的互相影响。心理因素指思考和处理我们的经验的方法，和我们对周围世界的认知。社会/文化因素指社会和文化对那些心理差异/疯癫进行互动的行为的限制，以及社会把我们标签为残障的污名。</td>

However, in using the term psychosocial, we have no in intention of associating ourselves with the psychosocial rehabilitation movement.  The term psychosocial disability is not yet understood in most countries of the world, and therefore, at the end of the negotiations, we agreed to use the more generally understood terminology of mental impairment in the text of the Convention.  Persons with mental impairments include users and survivors of psychiatry who experience or have experienced experiencing madness and/or mental health problems and/or are using or surviving, or have used or survived psychiatry/mental health services, as well as those of us who are perceived by others as having a mental disability/impairment.  </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
然而，在使用术语“社会心理的”这个词时，我们没有将我们自己与社会心理康复运动联系起来的意图。“社会心理残障”这一术语在世界上大多数国家还没有被了解。而因此，在协商的结尾，我们同意在公约文本中使用更加普遍被了解的术语“精神损伤”。有精神损伤的人士包括下列的精神医学使用者和幸存者——他们经历和已经经历过亲身体验的精神错乱和/或精神健康问题的，以及/或者是正在使用或幸存，或已经使用或者幸存于精神病科/精神康复服务的人士，以及那些我们当中被其他人认为有精神残障/损伤的人士。</td>

We prefer to use the term “psychosocial disability” and would like to introduce it into the vocabulary rather than use the term “mental impairment” when we are lobbying for implementation of the Convention.  We recognize that there may be difficulties in translating the word “psychosocial” into languages other than English.  We urge members of WNUSP to confer with each other and use their best judgment in making the translation.      </td>
<td class='tra'  lang='zh-CN'>
我们宁愿使用术语“社会心理残障”，并且在我们为实施公约进行游说时愿意把它引入词汇库，而不是使用术语“精神损伤”。在把“社会心理”一词翻译成除英语以外的语言时，我们承认可能存在困难。我们促使WNUSP成员相互对照，并在做翻译时使用他们最佳的判断。</td>

Articles 34 through 39 and the Optional Protocol to the Convention deal with the creation and responsibilities of an international committee of experts to monitor the Convention. Governments are encouraged to nominate experts with disabilities to serve on this committee. Governments must report to the committee and consult organizations of people with disabilities in preparing these reports; organizations of people with disabilities can also communicate with the committee directly to inform them about the situation in their country. People with disabilities whose human rights have been violated can make a complaint to the committee if their government has ratified the optional protocol. The committee also has the power to investigate “grave and systematic” human rights violations, including through country visits, if a country has ratified the optional protocol.

The social model of disability rejects the notion that the problem is within the individual, rather it is the society which does not meet the person in such a way that he or she can function.  Society must relate to the person in another way so that his or her difficulties in exercising legal capacity diminish.  If some people have difficulties communicating and expressing their wishes, the solution is to develop a relationship with the person and find ways to make it possible for the person to express and communicate what he or she wants.  </td>

A Personal Ombudsperson (PO) is a professional who has the skills required to advocate effectively for a client’s rights in front of various authorities or in a court of law.  All the PO’s of PO-Skåne have academic degrees or similar education.  Most of them are social workers, some are lawyers.  They come from various ethnic backgrounds.  The PO is not in alliance with psychiatry or social services or any other authority and not with the client’s relatives or any other person in the client’s surroundings.  The PO works only with the consent of his or her client. The PO does only what the client wants him or her to do.  It can take a long time, sometimes several months, before the client knows and dares to tell the PO what kind of help he or she wants.  The PO has to wait, even though a lot of things in the client’s life may be in chaos.  It usually takes the PO several years to develop a long-term relationship and build enough trust to be able to address essential matters.</td>

In other models, it is usually the clients who have to adjust to the bureaucratic system, but the PO-Skåne service works the other way.  The PO’s have to be very flexible and creative and unconventional in finding ways to work with their clients.  Many clients are very suspicious or hostile or hard to reach for other reasons.  The PO has to go out and meet them where they are.  Making contact sometimes takes several months.

A large class of pre-modern institutions or traditional healing centers nurture people in their existential quest for emotional and spiritual growth.  People who come there are not labeled with “mental illness”, though many bring emotional and other difficulties.  In a detailed study of more than 20 traditional healing centers in India, it became clear that these institutions organize their spaces and their philosophies around the experiences of distress, recovery and personal growth and not around “mental illness”.  Built into the values of such centers is a respect for each person’s capacity, as a person is fully involved in their own recovery process through the performance of ritual.  Most importantly, the centers value voluntarism and choice.</td>

Each center has its own philosophy, but some common themes related to personal recovery are: linkage to life, community, nature, to other human beings, to their own self-expression and to the cosmos/some transcendental dimension.  Health is mind/spirit/body, all together.  There is no “mental” separate from the bodily and the cosmological.  Many people were struggling with the personal and inter-personal, philosophical and existential questions of life and seeking, if not finding, answers through these centers.  They are not seen as “incapable” people.  The center acts as a retreat for those people to find themselves and move on in their lives.</td>

People who are seen as violent and dangerous are out in the open, in front of everybody, posing a moral question to the community all the time.  They might have been tied to a tree or to a stairway, but they maintained their interactions with the community.

They literally pin their hopes and pains, sometimes their aggressions, on the trees.

In one sect, the users seeking their own recovery can join a group of wanderers who wander and journey with sheep, caring for them.  It is believed that the sheep have miraculous healing powers.  The users live in the freedom and space of nature, their lives anchored to and their experiences shaped by the lives of the sheep.  Wandering minstrels are also found living or staying temporarily in many of these centers.

The local healing centers deal with personal agitation, anger and violence in a gentler, playful ritualized manner that brings the person back to the community quickly and does not fully rob the person of dignity, freedom and liberty.  Violence is seen as a part of existence and is attributed to external causes (e.g. spirits or demons) and so individual labeling or criminalizing does not occur.  The individual healers had sufficient inner stability and confidence in their practice and healing traditions to tame the angry spirits or demons and return the person intact and whole to the community.  Healers who believe they are protected by the divine are not afraid of human follies.  They do not exhibit anger or anxiety or fear when confronted with the violence of the evil spirit.  An angry and evil spirit spells trouble and destruction for the whole community, not just for the person – so the community has a stake in the safe return of their relative.  Any imputed or actual violence that happens in the context of suffering is understood as an indicator of external forces and as a community issue and remedies are sought within the healing and ritualized network rather than within an individualistic punishment framework. </td>

The Chinese symbol for crisis has two parts: “danger” and “opportunity”. Many of the most defining and pivotal revelations and changes in our lives emerge from such painful and chaotic times. Forced treatment of people deemed to be experiencing a mental health crisis assumes the worst, and in denying people their voice and choice, denies them also the chance to redefine themselves, change, grow and find the awaiting opportunities. The trauma experienced in such loss frequently damages our sense of autonomy, worth and self-determination. We come to believe that we are bad or dangerous, or that we require others to make decisions for us because we are incapable. One of the greatest losses we experience is the loss of our sense of who we are in the context of our community. An experience of forced treatment causes us to abandon our lives, and we return to a community that sees us as dangerous, vulnerable, volatile and “ill”.</td>

A number of peer-run alternatives to crisis have been developed over the years, and there is now a growing body of research available to both confirm their effectiveness, and to support their ongoing development. In their Crisis Hostel research project, Jeanne Dumont and Kristine Jones, found that the test group (who could choose between the hostel and hospitalization), had better healing outcomes, greater levels of empowerment, higher levels of self care, and a reduction in traditional crisis services than the control group who could only access the hospital. One study examined changes in the stories of people who had many previous hospitalizations and were now using a trauma-informed peer run crisis alternative. They found that, where many people had taken on a strong identity of “mental patient” after repeated hospitalizations, the alternative outcome included “critical learning” (being able to redefine one’s role, and not seeing one’s self as “crazy”).</td>

Peer-run crisis alternatives can operate from a set of assumptions completely different from traditional services. Traditional services focus of finding a diagnosis and treating it (predominantly pharmacologically) whereas crisis alternatives can focus on how people have made meaning out of their experience, building mutually responsible relationships, and creating “new stories.” Peer-run crisis alternatives that are trauma-informed recognize that past trauma (including psychiatric hospitalization) results in a way of seeing and relating that leaves people disconnected, isolated, and shamed, providing an awareness of how people’s individual painful life experiences (physical, sexual and emotional abuse, major loss, disaster, war, forced treatment, etc.) impact every aspect of their lives.</td>

Understanding that the way we see, relate, act and know occurs within the context of our histories, there is no assumption of a ‘problem’, and therefore no need for assessment or evaluation. Instead peers work at developing new ways of communicating their needs and feelings to one another without threat or coercion. For some of us, for example, thinking and speaking of Suicide is a way of dealing with our strong feelings. To be able to talk about what those feelings are (acknowledging that Suicide is not a feeling); when, why and how they arise, and having the option of exploring other ways of expressing them without the threat of hospitalization requires both the willingness to sit with the discomfort on both sides of the conversation, and the courage to negotiate other ways of thinking and talking about it. </td>

Trauma-informed peer support does not assume a diagnosis or a problem. Instead, the focus is on developing relationships that are committed to mutual learning, growth and challenging of one another.

Summary of an article written by Dan Hazen 
<br> 
<br>“An ex-patient voice has been let into the oftentimes oppressive psychiatric system to see that the needs of those who are often unheard are heard.  Clearly a milestone has been made through the efforts of a group of people who for years have been stigmatized, discriminated against, abused by the system and otherwise ‘kept down’ or kept quiet by certain factions in society.”  Gloria C. Hale
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy refers to the process or act of a person of equal standing pleading the cause of a person who shares that equal standing.  An example is a lawyer who provides a legal defense for another lawyer.  Another example is a person who has an experience of emotional difficulties or challenges providing advocacy for another person with similar experiences.  
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy was developed to assist persons who are, have been, or might become involved in the psychiatric system.  Peer Advocates speak out so that the individual’s choices and wishes are made clear and respected.    
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy is an innovative and exciting vehicle of empowerment.  Many people experience stigmatization and discrimination as a result of psychiatric labelling.  Peer advocates have a common bond of having received psychiatric treatment.  
<br> 
<br>What is a Peer Advocate: - Peer Advocacy is non-clinical and Peer Advocates are not part of the “mental health system”.
<br> 
<br>A Peer Advocate represents someone else’s interests.  The individual being represented is the person who should define his or her interests – within the bounds of the law and mutual propriety.  The job of the Peer Advocate is to help the individual get as much as possible of what he or she wants and what he or she is legally entitled to.  Peer Advocates inform the individual about the options, assist the person in expressing preferences, and ensure that these preferences are heard and vigorously pursued within the scope of the law.  A Peer Advocate may appear to be in charge, but this should never result in setting the goals for the individual.
<br> 
<br>Peer advocates may accompany the individual to situations such as “treatment team meetings”, discharge planning meeting, medication over objection hearings, and retention hearings in the court system.  (Forced treatment and detention must be stopped under the Convention, but there is still a role for Peer Advocates to ensure that these practices do not return.)  Peer Advocates may monitor court proceedings in a community to address and to report on violations of civil liberties and human rights.
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy ensures a practice of reasonable accommodation, supported decision making, and attempts to establish, expand, protect and enforce the human, legal and civil rights of people all people, particularly people engaged by the psychiatric/mental health system.</td>

When we advocate for no forced treatment and to abolish the insanity defense, we are faced with arguments not only like, "Do you let people with mental illness just die?" but also, “Do you want mentally ill people to face the death penalty or let them be in prisons?  It is too cruel."</td>

According to the principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reasonable accommodation must be provided if a person with a psychosocial disability is lawfully detained.  However, reasonable accommodation cannot justify low standards of human rights for all, or the existence of the death penalty, and so we must seek the 
<br>reform of the whole criminal justice system to fully realize reasonable accommodation for persons with psychosocial disabilities.  Furthermore, we support alternatives to incarceration and the discretion to refrain from prosecution where appropriate, so long as these measures do not 
<br>involve compulsory psychiatric treatment.</td>

<tr class='i untrans'>
<td class='src'  lang='en'>
While we cannot agree with the insanity defense in principle, it needs to be left open as a practical option as long as the death penalty and other harsh measures are being used in the penal system.  We think that all people should be protected from the death penalty and other punishments that cause great harm.  Such protection must not be conditioned on persons with disabilities accepting an inferior status of legal incapacity in the determination of responsibility for crimes.  Therefore we seek abolition of the insanity defense as part of a comprehensive penal reform.  We do not condone compulsory psychiatric detention or treatment for people acquitted by reason of insanity.</td>

8) Human Rights Council, created by the UN General Assembly (replaces the former Human Rights Commission).  Governments are elected to the Human Rights Council, which meets in Geneva to look into situations of concern both thematically and in individual countries.  The new mechanism of Universal Peer Review (UPR) will allow the Council to look into the human rights situation in each country, comprehensively.  NGOs can submit information to the Universal Peer Review process.  </td>

The Human Rights Council also designates Special Rapporteurs, who are independent experts assigned to look into situations and subject matter of concern to human rights.  For example, there is a Special Rapporteur on Torture, one on Health, one on Education, one on Violence against women.  It is possible that a Special Rapporteur on Disability or the Human Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be designated in the future.  However, at the present time, there is a Special Rapporteur on the Standard Rules on Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, who is appointed by the Commission on Social Development rather than the Human Rights Council.  NGOs and individuals can submit information to the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council; it is important to check the procedures and use any forms provided so that your information is handled in the best way.  </td>
