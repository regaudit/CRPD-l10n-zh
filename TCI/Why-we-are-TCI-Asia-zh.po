"Around 25 of ‘us’ came together for a significant meeting in 2013, in Pune, "
"from four Asian countries – Nepal, China, Philippines and India.* We were "
"people without an identity, along with our allies from the cross disability "
"movement and other unidentified ‘supporters’. [‘Mad studies’ had occupied a "
"niche and somewhat obscure domain](http://www.baputrust.com/aaina.html) in "
"India, a country which lives in the postcolonial shadow of legal and penal "
"legacies left behind by the British Raj concerning ‘lunatics’ and ‘idiots’. "
"Commonwealth countries continue to oppress peoples with those degrading and "
"deeply legally entrenched options for selfing ourselves."

"Our brief engagement in the [World Network of Users and Survivors of "
"Psychiatry (WNUSP)](http://www.wnusp.net/) offered the possibility of a "
"rather strong identity, which we Asians generally failed to inhabit: ‘users’ "
"and ‘survivors’ of psychiatry.  Several of us in Asia had been board members "
"or members of this organization, which made formidable contributions to the "
"UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) final text. "
"However, the context was white, north country, institution based psychiatry, "
"high income. We did not have the language or the resilience at the time to "
"present a subaltern narrative as people of colour from south country, "
"indigenous, diasporic, low income contexts where human rights violations "
"happened more in open communities or unregulated social institutions than in "
"highly regulated closed door mental institutions. Activism in Europe too was "
"around the identity of ‘users and survivors’. We, from the global south, did "
"not have spaces in other global movements – Intervoice, INTAR etc., for "
"example – which were asserting our rights to be freed from coercion until "
"more recently."

"India was among the first nations in Asia to sign the CRPD. This mobilized "
"us, those of us without an identity and without access to any support "
"systems, within the larger cross disability movement in Asia and elsewhere. "
"The CRPD trainings offered by the International Disability Alliance in Asia "
"opened up many insightful doors about inclusion and access to Development, "
"and gave us new identity possibilities, of ‘persons with psychosocial "
"disabilities’. The time spent in Pune, with peers and supporters, brought "
"the consensus that a disability identity offered us a chance at life whereas "
"the identity of ‘user and survivor’ only pitched us against the dominant "
"medical establishments."

"However, attaining clarity and consensus on assuming the identity of persons "
"with psychosocial disabilities is a long process, as identity questions "
"often are. Activists had emerged as ‘users and survivors’ from high income "
"Asia countries (Japan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong) and the commonwealth "
"countries (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, etc.), "
"which depended on coercive institutionalization in place of ‘care’. There "
"were also the Asian identity, the identity of being from the global south, a "
"kind of celebration, even, of our unity in diversity, to come together as "
"oppressed peoples from this region. Other identities were strong too: of "
"being minority, woman, gay, transgender, people of colour, etc. Through our "
"engagement in Asia, and thriving debates over several plenary events and "
"participation in worldwide debates on disability identities and experiences, "
"new collectives emerged, for example the Psychosocial Disability Inclusive "
"Philippines (PDI-P), Korean Association for Mobilizing Inclusion (KAMI), and "
"Peer Support Thailand.\n"

"We, in Asia, have taken the CRPD to our hearts because of its inspiring "
"vision of an inclusive world for all. The CRPD is a smoothie of "
"traditionally given human rights, in a format that makes it taste fresh, "
"healthy and new. The framing of human rights changed with the CRPD – ‘"
"reasonable accommodation’ customized human rights to the dictum that “A "
"person is a person, no matter how small.” A smoothie made of several rights –"
" Articles 12 (Right to legal capacity), 14 (liberty), 15 (freedom from "
"abuse, violence and exploitation), 16 (freedom from cruel, inhuman degrading "
"and torturous treatments), 17 (integrity) and, the mother of them all, 19 ("
"Living independently and being included in communities) – was heady. They "
"predicted that forced treatment in all settings would end; and in many "
"places, would never begin. Violence everywhere against persons with "
"psychosocial disabilities would end."

"We were eager to understand Article 19 because all other roads seem to end "
"here:  A person needs to be living in a place of choice; with people who "
"they care to live with; having access to all kinds of general and specific "
"services and community based systems of support; on equal basis with others. "
"However, pedagogy on Article 19, when compared to Articles 12 (legal "
"capacity) or 14 (Liberty and security), is very limited, even non-existent. "
"Legal traditions anywhere in the world, have prescribed what should not "
"happen. But notions like human connection, support, care, community etc., "
"which bring people together as a human society, have not been explicated "
"within law. Since family members are, frequently enough, the perpetrators of "
"violence against persons with disabilities, there was deep mistrust and "
"skepticism about evoking any notion of ‘care’ or ‘community’ in the north "
"country context. South country low income experiences, however, were more "
"ambiguous in their responses to family, and open in terms of willingness to "
"dialogue but also transform social relationships."

"Social contract theorists like James Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, John Mill, "
"et. al., who birthed modernity and the modern political systems, are perhaps "
"to blame for this serious omission, the ambiguity, or even the subtle "
"ambience of paranoia that we seem to inhabit today. The social contract "
"theorists gave a view of human society where every exchange was a rule-bound "
"negotiation. Contracting came prior to human engagement. Mutual trust was "
"ever in doubt. And a holding of hands, so to speak, among fellow human "
"beings, always needed to be deconstructed with respect to personal "
"maleficent motives.  Considering that every treatment action was "
"contractual, within this broader frame of human exchange, the battle in the "
"global north has been combative, aiming to establish ‘voluntary and informed "
"consent’."

"However, the CRPD gave us a framework of human society as based on mutual "
"respect, interdependence and support, if not care. This vision for human "
"society resonated with us in the global south, for many of whom support "
"still came from the immediate circles of care. For us, the struggle for ‘"
"voluntary and informed consent’ is itself too narrow, and defined against a "
"system which gave us either pills or institutions. There was more to life "
"than battling psychiatrists. The CRPD gave us choice in the widest sense "
"possible, within development processes, not limited to and inclusive of "
"informed consent within healthcare settings, and a whole range of people in "
"support function. The General Comment 5 from the Monitoring Committee of the "
"CRPD recently gave elaboration on this right."

"Asia is an emerging economic power and, in direct proportion to that, a "
"lucrative site for pharmacracy. Clarion calls by the global mental health "
"movement to ‘fill the treatment gap’ of ‘mental disorders’ is resulting in "
"growth of traditional mental health care of pills and institutions. This "
"kind of ‘modernisation’, as Mr Puras has described well, is leading to "
"increase in the ‘global burden of barriers’, newer forms of coercion, for "
"example modification of old institutions (jails, ‘vagrant homes’, social "
"care institutions) for involuntarily incarcerating persons with psychosocial "
"disabilities, and euphemisms for coercion (for example ‘high support need "

"New laws in India (Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act of 2016, Mental "
"Health Care Act of 2017) are now starting to consider inclusion as a human "
"right. However, the fulfilment of this right remains to be seen. New MH "
"legislation, where they have been made, just like the old ones, has only led "
"to greater violence and violation, enduring detention, isolation and "
"segregation, possibly for life. For example, South Korea’s new Mental Health "
"Act has resulted in the growth of hundreds of closed door institutions and "
"the highest average of days spent in involuntary commitment per person."

"No amount of stories told about serious human rights violations within "
"institutions and coercive treatment will result in Inclusion, as that is "
"_another_ kind of practice. The [WHO Quality Rights Training "
"program](http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/quality_rights/en/) has "
"come in recently with new promise of a world without institutions. But what "
"it will only do is correct individual behaviours within the mental health "
"system, not fragment the system itself, which is what is needed. WHO QR "
"makes rights violations a deviance in interpersonal exchanges between the "
"asylum staff and the patients (sic) and not a deviance of the whole system, "
"its laws and institutions, or from core human values and our essential "
"nature to peacefully cohabit and care."

"TCI Asia is interested to promote imagination as well as investments on "
"community based inclusion practices for their heuristic value, and for "
"realizing Article 19 for persons with psychosocial disabilities. By now, TCI "
"Asia has established that traditional mental health treatment will not lead "
"to inclusion, rather the opposite will happen. ‘Recovery’ will not lead to "
"inclusion; ‘Peer support’ in the way it is delivered within the medical "
"paradigm will not lead to inclusion. These are all silos, occurring within "
"the epiphany of ‘mental illness’ and its ‘treatment’. Further, actions for "
"the human rights of liberty and legal capacity will not result in inclusion, "
"as those actions are silos too."

"Inclusion is a broad range of collaborative actions in local communities, "
"addressing the capacity building needs of everyone. For a person to be "
"included, the world around them must be transformed to be inclusive. "
"Reducing the existing barriers and enabling communities to start to include "
"are the expected outcomes from inclusion programs. Inclusion is an everyday "
"practice which requires transformative learning cycles within families, "
"within households, within communities and neighbourhoods. Good practice "
