"Around 25 of ‘us’ came together for a significant meeting in 2013, in Pune, "
"from four Asian countries – Nepal, China, Philippines and India.* We were "
"people without an identity, along with our allies from the cross disability "
"movement and other unidentified ‘supporters’. [‘Mad studies’ had occupied a "
"niche and somewhat obscure domain](http://www.baputrust.com/aaina.html) in "
"India, a country which lives in the postcolonial shadow of legal and penal "
"legacies left behind by the British Raj concerning ‘lunatics’ and ‘idiots’. "
"Commonwealth countries continue to oppress peoples with those degrading and "
"deeply legally entrenched options for selfing ourselves."

"Our brief engagement in the [World Network of Users and Survivors of "
"Psychiatry (WNUSP)](http://www.wnusp.net/) offered the possibility of a "
"rather strong identity, which we Asians generally failed to inhabit: ‘users’ "
"and ‘survivors’ of psychiatry.  Several of us in Asia had been board members "
"or members of this organization, which made formidable contributions to the "
"UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) final text. "
"However, the context was white, north country, institution based psychiatry, "
"high income. We did not have the language or the resilience at the time to "
"present a subaltern narrative as people of colour from south country, "
"indigenous, diasporic, low income contexts where human rights violations "
"happened more in open communities or unregulated social institutions than in "
"highly regulated closed door mental institutions. Activism in Europe too was "
"around the identity of ‘users and survivors’. We, from the global south, did "
"not have spaces in other global movements – Intervoice, INTAR etc., for "
"example – which were asserting our rights to be freed from coercion until "
"more recently."

"做出了卓越的贡献。然而，整个语境仍然是白人的、“北方国家的”、基于住院型精神医学的、高收入的。"
"我们在那个时候没法用语言或用我们的韧性来表达来自“南方国家”的、有色人种的、本土的、流亡的、低收入环境的亚另类（subaltern）叙事。"
"这种环境中人权侵犯更经常发生在开放的社区或未很好规范的社会机构，多过发生在规范得好的封闭型精神病院。"
"欧洲的（障碍权利）运动也是围绕着“使用者和幸存者”身份的。我们，来自“南方国家”，在其他全球性运动中也是没有什么空间的 ——比如 Intervoices、INTAR 等——他们直到最近才伸张关于我们从强权中获得自由的权利。"

"India was among the first nations in Asia to sign the CRPD. This mobilized "
"us, those of us without an identity and without access to any support "
"systems, within the larger cross disability movement in Asia and elsewhere. "
"The CRPD trainings offered by the International Disability Alliance in Asia "
"opened up many insightful doors about inclusion and access to Development, "
"and gave us new identity possibilities, of ‘persons with psychosocial "
"disabilities’. The time spent in Pune, with peers and supporters, brought "
"the consensus that a disability identity offered us a chance at life whereas "
"the identity of ‘user and survivor’ only pitched us against the dominant "
"medical establishments."

"IDA（国际残障联盟）在亚洲做的CRPD培训，让我们在融合和发展权上开了眼界，并给了我们新的身份的可能性：“社会心理障碍者”。"
"在浦那和友伴及支持者在一起所花的时间，让我们形成了一个共识：残障者的身份能给我们一个生活的机会，而“使用者/幸存者”的身份"
"仍然让我们在对抗主流医学系统中挣扎（并耗尽了一生——译者注）。"

"However, attaining clarity and consensus on assuming the identity of persons "
"with psychosocial disabilities is a long process, as identity questions "
"often are. Activists had emerged as ‘users and survivors’ from high income "
"Asia countries (Japan, China, South Korea, Hong Kong) and the commonwealth "
"countries (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, etc.), "
"which depended on coercive institutionalization in place of ‘care’. There "
"were also the Asian identity, the identity of being from the global south, a "
"kind of celebration, even, of our unity in diversity, to come together as "
"oppressed peoples from this region. Other identities were strong too: of "
"being minority, woman, gay, transgender, people of colour, etc. Through our "
"engagement in Asia, and thriving debates over several plenary events and "
"participation in worldwide debates on disability identities and experiences, "
"new collectives emerged, for example the Psychosocial Disability Inclusive "
"Philippines (PDI-P), Korean Association for Mobilizing Inclusion (KAMI), and "

"英联邦国家（印度、孟加拉、巴基斯坦、新加坡、马来西亚、缅甸等等）总是在所谓“关怀照顾”的地方出现霸权的封闭机构化。"
"还有一些亚洲国家，带着“南方国家”的身份，以一种庆祝的方式，以被压迫者身份走在一起。其他身份也很强劲："

"We, in Asia, have taken the CRPD to our hearts because of its inspiring "
"vision of an inclusive world for all. The CRPD is a smoothie of "
"traditionally given human rights, in a format that makes it taste fresh, "
"healthy and new. The framing of human rights changed with the CRPD – ‘"
"reasonable accommodation’ customized human rights to the dictum that “A "
"person is a person, no matter how small.” A smoothie made of several rights –"
" Articles 12 (Right to legal capacity), 14 (liberty), 15 (freedom from "
"abuse, violence and exploitation), 16 (freedom from cruel, inhuman degrading "
"and torturous treatments), 17 (integrity) and, the mother of them all, 19 ("

"在亚洲的我们，已经把CRPD融到了我们心里，因为它体现着对包容所有人的世界的愿景。CRPD就是一杯传统人权的奶昔甜品，让人感到新鲜美味、健康和新奇。"
"人权的框架都被CRPD重构——“合理便利”是对人权的个性化定义，表达的是“人就是人，不管ta多么小”。这杯奶昔由这几个权利组成："
"第12条（法律能力权利）、第14条（人身自由）、第15条（免受虐待、暴力和剥削的自由）、第16条（免受残酷、非人性有辱人格的和折磨性的治疗的自由）、第17条（身心整合性）以及它们之母，第19条"

"We were eager to understand Article 19 because all other roads seem to end "
"here:  A person needs to be living in a place of choice; with people who "
"they care to live with; having access to all kinds of general and specific "
"services and community based systems of support; on equal basis with others. "
"However, pedagogy on Article 19, when compared to Articles 12 (legal "
"capacity) or 14 (Liberty and security), is very limited, even non-existent. "
"Legal traditions anywhere in the world, have prescribed what should not "
"happen. But notions like human connection, support, care, community etc., "
"which bring people together as a human society, have not been explicated "
"within law. Since family members are, frequently enough, the perpetrators of "
"violence against persons with disabilities, there was deep mistrust and "
"skepticism about evoking any notion of ‘care’ or ‘community’ in the north "
"country context. South country low income experiences, however, were more "
"ambiguous in their responses to family, and open in terms of willingness to "
"dialogue but also transform social relationships."

"我们非常渴望了解第19条，因为其它所有的道路似乎都到此结束：生活在一个是ta自己选择的地方是每个人的需要；"
"以及ta可以选择和谁一起生活；可以获得所有种类的一般和特别的社会服务和基于社区的支持系统，并且是跟他人平等的基础上。"
"然而，第19条在实践方法学（pedagogy）的积累一直还很有限，甚至一点都没有（与第12条（法律能力）、第14条（人身自由和安全）相比较）。"
"世界上任何地方的法律传统，都是对“什么不能发生”进行规定，但对于比如人际连结、支持、关怀、社区等等让人成为人类社会的观念，并不会用法律阐明。"
"因为家庭成员在很大频率上都是对社心障碍者施加暴力的施暴者，所以在“北方国家”语境中对呼唤“关怀”、“社区”等这样的观念有很深的不信任和怀疑。"
"但是，带有低收入经历的“南方国家”，他们对于家庭的态度并没有那么是非分明，且会（对家庭）更开放以寄望于对话但也渴望社交关系的转型。"

"Social contract theorists like James Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, John Mill, "
"et. al., who birthed modernity and the modern political systems, are perhaps "
"to blame for this serious omission, the ambiguity, or even the subtle "
"ambience of paranoia that we seem to inhabit today. The social contract "
"theorists gave a view of human society where every exchange was a rule-bound "
"negotiation. Contracting came prior to human engagement. Mutual trust was "
"ever in doubt. And a holding of hands, so to speak, among fellow human "
"beings, always needed to be deconstructed with respect to personal "
"maleficent motives.  Considering that every treatment action was "
"contractual, within this broader frame of human exchange, the battle in the "
"global north has been combative, aiming to establish ‘voluntary and informed "
"consent’."

"论述现代性和产生现代政治体制的社会契约理论家们如James Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, John Mill 等"
"都或会谴责这种严重的疏漏、模糊性甚至是我们当前栖居的微妙的偏执环境。社会契约理论家给出了这样一种观点："
"人类社会的每一次交流都是一次受规则约束的协商。立约的重要性总是高于对人的关注。互相的信任就更（容易）受质疑。而人们的每一次握手，"
"总是需要被解构为其背后的个人邪恶动机。那么鉴于每一个治疗行为都是一种合同，在这样的人类交互的框架下，“北方国家”（人们）的旨在建立（医疗的）“自愿和知情同意”的斗争就显得很有意义。"

"However, the CRPD gave us a framework of human society as based on mutual "
"respect, interdependence and support, if not care. This vision for human "
"society resonated with us in the global south, for many of whom support "
"still came from the immediate circles of care. For us, the struggle for ‘"
"voluntary and informed consent’ is itself too narrow, and defined against a "
"system which gave us either pills or institutions. There was more to life "
"than battling psychiatrists. The CRPD gave us choice in the widest sense "
"possible, within development processes, not limited to and inclusive of "
"informed consent within healthcare settings, and a whole range of people in "
"support function. The General Comment 5 from the Monitoring Committee of the "
"CRPD recently gave elaboration on this right."

"然而，CRPD 提供了一种“人类社会是基于互相尊重、互相依存和支持的而不是照顾”这样的框架，"
"在“南方语境”的我们对这种人类社会的愿景是有共鸣的，我们很多人的支持系统还只是来自各自的即时/最近照顾圈（即非正式照顾系统）。"
"对我们来说，追求“自愿和知情同意”本身过于狭窄，并且这样（的思路）把我们对自己的定义局限在了那些发给我们药物或住院的系统的对立面。"
"实际上生活/生命的含义不只是与精神科医生对抗。CRPD给了我们在可能的范围内、在各发展进程中最广阔的理解度，包括但不限于对医疗机构的知情同意。"
"CRPD 监察委员会近来发布的《一般性意见第5号》就这项权利做了详尽的诠释。"
