"A group of persons with psychosocial disabilities, and some cross disability "
"supporters, in Asia connected and met regularly, since 2012, with the "
"support of the Bapu Trust, Pune (www.baputrust.com) and the International "
"Disability Alliance (www.internationaldisabilityalliance.org). The group "
"took the name of \"TransAsian strategy group\" (2012-2014), eventually "
"becoming, *\"Transforming Communities for Inclusion of persons with "
"psychosocial disabilities - Asia\" (TCI-Asia),* in Bangkok, in November of "
"2014."

"Within the broader human rights frame set up by the UNCRPD, TCI Asia in the "
"last years has consistently worked on the pedagogy and practices around "
"Article 19. Over this time, we have centered the advocacy around "
"'Inclusion', understanding what this means, how to practice it, how to bring "
"it into policies in our region; and worldwide engagements on inclusion."

"There has been a significant shifting ground on global policy thinking and "
"practices on the inclusion of persons with psychosocial disabilities. The "
"new language is being developed somewhere moving from the \"global burden of "
"mental disorders and filling the treatment gap [1]\" to removing the \""
"global burden of obstacles [2]\". At the center of this shift is the "
"elaboration of Article 19 by the CRPD committee, its concluding "
"observations, General Comments, as well as the recent works of the special "
"procedures of the Human Rights Council, among others."

"In our work of the last 2 years, we spotlight important regional / global "
"events driven by those different, diverse perspectives, including the WHO / "
"World Bank meeting [3] on global mental health; INTAR India 2016[4] and post "
"INTAR global convenings (Pune, Galway, Trieste); the WHO collaborating "
"center; Galway Summer School on rights of persons with psychosocial "
"disabilities (2017) [5]. It is concerning that a number of new global mental "
"health networks have emerged in this time [6] [7], some of them being "
"visibly supported by psycho-pharmaceuticals like Johnson & Johnson [8]."

"A significant development is the series of reports emerging from the United "
"Nations, including the OHCHR Report [9], Draft General comment (Article 19) "
"[10], Report of SR (Health)[11], Report of SR (Disability) \"on support\" "
"[12], and the new, refreshed WHO Quality Rights training kit [13]. The SDGs "
"elicited a substantial response as well, acting as an amplifier for the "
"global mental health movement but also providing opportunities for advocacy "
"for international DPOs. There was also much debate within the constituency "
"of persons with psychosocial disabilities around whether and how mental "
"health must be read within the context of the SDGs. Through these "
"developments, the gap in communication may seem to be shrinking through many "
"open dialogues. The hallmark slogan that *'Coercion is a failure'* [14] "
"however suggests that much remains to be done."

"Fueled by growing economies, business interests and public spending as well "
"as policy framework promoting social constraint and control to support the "
"growth of economy, there is a big momentum in Asia for policy interventions "
"intended to 'fill the treatment gap' and new alliances are being built to "
"scale up medical treatments but the global debate is also echoed in the "
"region. There has been many Asia-focused publications and reports, from a "
"medical as well as inclusion perspective, for example, an ASEAN report [15], "
"and a report from WHO-SEARO and the TEAR fund report [16], other than "
"innumerable psychiatric articles published in open access journals on the \""
"alarming rise of mental disorders\" in the Asian region."

"While there are several open windows of opportunities for effecting change "
"in thinking and practice, there is a big need to reframe the policy "
"questions in line with the CRPD. TCI Asia movement has been striving to do "
"so in the last 2 years by being quite responsive to the global scenario, and "
"being very active at the regional level, enabling national advocacy in "
"member countries."
