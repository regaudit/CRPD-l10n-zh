Our biggest victory – a paradigm shift away from a model based on paternalism to one based on respect for our human rights – is in the text of Article 12 on legal capacity.  States have to recognize that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others.  What does this mean?  We understand legal capacity in the sense of capacity to act, which is both the right to make decisions, and a legal status equal with other adults in one's society.  Deciding whether to accept medical treatment or go into a hospital is an exercise of legal capacity.  If someone else, whether a doctor, court, or imposed guardian, is authorized by law to substitute their will for your own, this deprives you of the right to exercise legal capacity on an equal basis with others.  Mental health commitment laws violate Article 12.  In addition, the whole system of guardianship violates Article 12.  Sometimes people are put under guardianship and the guardian can put them into a psychiatric institution and consent on their behalf to forced ECT and drugs.  Instead of a guardian, the person should be offered support if he or she chooses it; and the support has to respect his or her will and preferences (from Article 12.4).  </td>

An international team of users and survivors of psychiatry, led by Tina Minkowitz, participated actively in the negotiations at the United Nations (UN) in New York from the first session of the Ad Hoc Committee in August 2002 through the adoption of the completed text on December 13, 2006.  The Ad Hoc Committee was a unique process for all of us.  We seized a historic opportunity and accomplished something basic and fundamental that has changed the human rights landscape for us and for all people with disabilities.  Many of us made lasting friendships with each other and with other people with disabilities and allies, from around the world.  Working together closely, over the course of several years, in person at the UN and by email discussions, we brought user/survivor issues into the heart of the disability movement and found a rich common ground, especially on the issue of legal capacity, which is the ultimate test of the guarantee of full and equal enjoyment of human rights.  </td>

Users and survivors from the World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry (WNUSP), MindFreedom/Support Coalition International (MF/SCI) and other organizations came to the UN from  Canada,  Denmark,  Ghana,  Guinea,  Hungary,  Ireland,  India,  Japan,  New Zealand,  Nicaragua,  Peru,  Sweden,  Uganda,  the United Kingdom,  and the United States of America.  WNUSP members served on New Zealand’s and Sweden’s government delegations.  We were an impressive force.  WNUSP helped to create the International Disability Caucus (IDC) and participated actively in its governance through our seat on the steering committee.  The IDC had a principle of respecting the leadership of disabled people’s organizations (DPOs), and respecting any particular DPO on matters relating to its constituency.  In addition, we agreed that the Convention should “be equally relevant to all persons with disabilities, irrespective of the type of disability or geographical location”.  This helped to ensure solidarity. </td>

WNUSP contributed several position papers of our own, including proposed text for the treaty, much of which was accepted.  When the IDC began working together to present a unified position, we authored and/or coordinated the work of the IDC on some important articles, including Article 12 on legal capacity, Article 14 on liberty, Article 15 on torture, Article 17 on integrity of the person, Article 22 on privacy, Article 23 on home and family, Article 27 on employment, Article 29 on political participation, and part of Article 25 on health.  An important aspect of our work was building alliances, building consensus, and learning to collaborate with other disability rights activists.   Finally the IDC spoke with one coherent and powerful voice to promote a human rights agenda for all persons with disabilities.    </td>

WNUSP involvement started even before the first Ad Hoc Committee meeting, when we learned of a meeting being held in Mexico City in June 2002 to bring together experts to discuss the Convention.  WNUSP requested and received an invitation, and submitted a paper that set out the main tenets of our advocacy as well as commenting on the draft text that the Mexican government had prepared.  The meeting successfully established our role in the community of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and our advocacy was made part of a paper agreed to by the NGOs at the meeting.</td>

The first Ad Hoc Committee meeting established an agreement to continue the process of “considering proposals for a Convention,” and the second (in June 2003) agreed to set up a working group to produce a draft text for negotiation, drawing on proposals submitted by governments and civil society (including WNUSP).  Tina Minkowitz represented WNUSP as one of 12 NGOs that participated in the working group, along with 27 governments and one national human rights institution.  In this group, which convened in January 2004, all participants had an equal voice and collaborated to produce the resulting text.  Users and survivors of psychiatry finally had a seat at the table and spoke with a passion and clarity that was heard around the world.  </td>

Then it was time for negotiation, when all governments and civil society organizations (including those that had not participated in the working group) had the opportunity first to improve the text, and then to settle on a final version that everyone could live with.  It was not an easy process, and attempts were also made to weaken the text.  However, the IDC’s approval was sought and wanted, since we represented the constituency that is supposed to benefit from the Convention.  This was important for WNUSP in securing recognition of equal legal capacity, liberty on an equal basis, free and informed consent and right to respect for integrity of the person, all without the limitations that had previously been inserted into documents dealing with the rights of users and survivors of psychiatry.  WNUSP and MF/SCI participated in several side events during the Ad Hoc Committee meetings primarily focusing on the importance of recognition of legal capacity on an equal basis with others and of the freedom to make our own decisions.  We worked hard and lobbied hard, and had to listen to a lot of disrespectful opinions.  In the last stages of the process we had to deal with a betrayal of our interests in a political process, when a footnote was inserted limiting the meaning of legal capacity in Arabic, Chinese and Russian to “capacity for rights” and not “capacity to act”.  But we were able to turn this around, with the help of our IDC allies and many governments who did not accept the footnote, and removing the footnote was the victory that capped our experience.  </td>

This manual is intended for users and survivors of psychiatry, and user/survivor organizations, as an informational guide and reference for working with the Convention.  Users and survivors have the opportunity to work with their government, through a national consultation process, on implementing the Convention, and also incorporate the Convention into advocacy they are doing (for instance, to get people out of institutions or stop forced drugging or electroshock).  The Convention is a rich document and people may choose to focus on one or another area, depending on circumstances and priorities.  </td>

We have highlighted the aspects of the Convention that address the human rights violations especially targeted against users and survivors of psychiatry, in the areas of legal capacity, liberty and right to live in the community, freedom from forced psychiatric interventions, our inclusion as people with disabilities and participation in enforcement mechanisms.  These are the areas that we believe will make a difference in the lives of all users and survivors of psychiatry, and without which other guarantees, such as the right to work and the right to vote, are meaningless to us.</td>

Users and survivors of psychiatry are urged to read this manual together with the text of the Convention, and to apply it creatively to situations they are facing.  Besides guaranteeing specific rights, the Convention requires equality and non-discrimination in the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  If the Convention and this manual do not address a particular situation, users and survivors can find the articles that seem most relevant and make their best argument.  Human rights lawyers can help, but may also need to be educated by the user/survivor movement to present our issues correctly.  </td>

We face challenges in implementing the Convention, since there is as yet no government that complies with its requirements in relation to users and survivors of psychiatry.  Many governments will contest the obligations in the Convention and fight to keep their guardianship and mental health laws, to continue psychiatric detention and violence, and promote a deficit-based view of psychosocial disability requiring medical model “treatments”.  They will try to find loopholes or interpret it to make exceptions for the obligations they would rather not comply with.  However, we have had many victories in the process of creating the Convention, and there are encouraging signs that our message has been heard by some governments, and that our allies in the disability and human rights communities will continue to work with us at the international and national levels.  The challenges we face are not unique to our situation but are the same challenges faced by any group of disenfranchised people claiming our human rights as recognized in an international treaty.  Our movement has matured a great deal through the treaty process and will continue to meet the challenges to break through to real change in the lives of users and survivors of psychiatry everywhere.  </td>

A: The concept of legal capacity has been used to deny personhood and to disqualify users and survivors from managing our own lives. Art 12 of the CRPD has dismantled these deprivations by conferring personhood to all persons with disabilities and by recognizing that we have the legal capacity to run our own lives.  Also if we so desire, we can seek support to exercise our legal capacity. Thus support is no longer inflicted upon us whether we want I it or not, rather it is assistance which has to be made available if we wish to use it.  </td>

A: Article 17 grants to all persons with disabilities the right to respect for their physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others.  It is this right which protects persons who do not have disabilities from unwelcome treatment, forcible confinement or any other unwelcome invasion of their body and mind.  Article 17, by its guarantee of equality and non discrimination, also makes these available to us.  This guarantee is further strengthened by the fact that article 25 obliges health care professionals to provide treatment only on the basis of free and informed consent.  Free and informed consent can only be given by the person concerned, and not by family members, courts or others.  (This follows from the guarantee of legal capacity).  In addition under article 15 the Convention protects the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which includes medical or scientific experimentation without consent.  The cumulative effect of these provisions is to oust forced psychiatry.   </td>

During the negotiations, it was impossible for the parties to agree on a definition of disability that included all persons with disabilities and excluded no person with a disability.  The Preamble of the Convention in subparagraph (e) recognizes “that disability is an evolving concept.”  Article 1 of the Convention states that, “The purpose of the present Convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.  Persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.”</td>

During the course of the negotiations, WNUSP developed language to refer to persons with psychiatric disabilities that moved away from the medical model of individual pathology.  We described ourselves as persons with psychosocial disabilities.  The word psychosocial refers to the interaction between psychological and social/cultural components of our disability.  The psychological component refers to ways of thinking and processing our experiences and our perception of the world around us.  The social/cultural component refers to societal and cultural limits for behavior that interact with those psychological differences/madness as well as the stigma that the society attaches to labeling us as disabled. </td>

However, in using the term psychosocial, we have no in intention of associating ourselves with the psychosocial rehabilitation movement.  The term psychosocial disability is not yet understood in most countries of the world, and therefore, at the end of the negotiations, we agreed to use the more generally understood terminology of mental impairment in the text of the Convention.  Persons with mental impairments include users and survivors of psychiatry who experience or have experienced experiencing madness and/or mental health problems and/or are using or surviving, or have used or survived psychiatry/mental health services, as well as those of us who are perceived by others as having a mental disability/impairment.  </td>

Article 12 guarantees the right to enjoy legal capacity, including both the capacity to have rights and the capacity to act (to exercise rights and responsibilities and make decisions in everyday life), and requires governments to provide access to support in exercising legal capacity for those who may need it; any measures related to the exercise of legal capacity must respect a person’s rights, will and preferences, and safeguards must be established to prevent abuse.
<br>What needs to be done:
<br>Article 12 is the most innovative and far-reaching provision in the Convention, and has a major significance for users and survivors of psychiatry.  Instead of being treated as non-persons to be acted on by others, assistance will be offered in times of crisis, confusion or distress, which we have the right to accept or refuse.  
<br>1) Repeal guardianship and incapacity laws and provisions throughout the legal system. 
<br>2) Abolish the insanity defense and replace with disability-neutral standards for adjudicating criminal responsibility (e.g. actual criminal intent, taking account of the circumstances of the crime, motivation, etc.).
<br>3) Develop mechanisms to provide support in making decisions to a wide range of people with disabilities with diverse needs.  
<br>4) In supported decision-making, the judgment and will of the person are not contested, unlike in guardianship and substituted decision-making. 
<br>5) Agencies that habitually deal with acts requiring an exercise of legal capacity (such as banks, notaries, judges, medical personnel) need to provide some support measures as a form of reasonable accommodation.

The social model of disability rejects the notion that the problem is within the individual, rather it is the society which does not meet the person in such a way that he or she can function.  Society must relate to the person in another way so that his or her difficulties in exercising legal capacity diminish.  If some people have difficulties communicating and expressing their wishes, the solution is to develop a relationship with the person and find ways to make it possible for the person to express and communicate what he or she wants.  </td>

A Personal Ombudsperson (PO) is a professional who has the skills required to advocate effectively for a client’s rights in front of various authorities or in a court of law.  All the PO’s of PO-Skåne have academic degrees or similar education.  Most of them are social workers, some are lawyers.  They come from various ethnic backgrounds.  The PO is not in alliance with psychiatry or social services or any other authority and not with the client’s relatives or any other person in the client’s surroundings.  The PO works only with the consent of his or her client. The PO does only what the client wants him or her to do.  It can take a long time, sometimes several months, before the client knows and dares to tell the PO what kind of help he or she wants.  The PO has to wait, even though a lot of things in the client’s life may be in chaos.  It usually takes the PO several years to develop a long-term relationship and build enough trust to be able to address essential matters.</td>

The PO has to go out and meet them where they are.  Making contact sometimes takes several months.

A large class of pre-modern institutions or traditional healing centers nurture people in their existential quest for emotional and spiritual growth.  People who come there are not labeled with “mental illness”, though many bring emotional and other difficulties.  In a detailed study of more than 20 traditional healing centers in India, it became clear that these institutions organize their spaces and their philosophies around the experiences of distress, recovery and personal growth and not around “mental illness”.  Built into the values of such centers is a respect for each person’s capacity, as a person is fully involved in their own recovery process through the performance of ritual.  Most importantly, the centers value voluntarism and choice.</td>

Many people were struggling with the personal and inter-personal, philosophical and existential questions of life and seeking, if not finding, answers through these centers.

The local healing centers deal with personal agitation, anger and violence in a gentler, playful ritualized manner that brings the person back to the community quickly and does not fully rob the person of dignity, freedom and liberty.  Violence is seen as a part of existence and is attributed to external causes (e.g. spirits or demons) and so individual labeling or criminalizing does not occur.  The individual healers had sufficient inner stability and confidence in their practice and healing traditions to tame the angry spirits or demons and return the person intact and whole to the community.  Healers who believe they are protected by the divine are not afraid of human follies.  They do not exhibit anger or anxiety or fear when confronted with the violence of the evil spirit.  An angry and evil spirit spells trouble and destruction for the whole community, not just for the person – so the community has a stake in the safe return of their relative.  Any imputed or actual violence that happens in the context of suffering is understood as an indicator of external forces and as a community issue and remedies are sought within the healing and ritualized network rather than within an individualistic punishment framework. </td>

The Chinese symbol for crisis has two parts: “danger” and “opportunity”. Many of the most defining and pivotal revelations and changes in our lives emerge from such painful and chaotic times. Forced treatment of people deemed to be experiencing a mental health crisis assumes the worst, and in denying people their voice and choice, denies them also the chance to redefine themselves, change, grow and find the awaiting opportunities. The trauma experienced in such loss frequently damages our sense of autonomy, worth and self-determination. We come to believe that we are bad or dangerous, or that we require others to make decisions for us because we are incapable. One of the greatest losses we experience is the loss of our sense of who we are in the context of our community. An experience of forced treatment causes us to abandon our lives, and we return to a community that sees us as dangerous, vulnerable, volatile and “ill”.</td>

A number of peer-run alternatives to crisis have been developed over the years, and there is now a growing body of research available to both confirm their effectiveness, and to support their ongoing development. In their Crisis Hostel research project, Jeanne Dumont and Kristine Jones, found that the test group (who could choose between the hostel and hospitalization), had better healing outcomes, greater levels of empowerment, higher levels of self care, and a reduction in traditional crisis services than the control group who could only access the hospital. One study examined changes in the stories of people who had many previous hospitalizations and were now using a trauma-informed peer run crisis alternative. They found that, where many people had taken on a strong identity of “mental patient” after repeated hospitalizations, the alternative outcome included “critical learning” (being able to redefine one’s role, and not seeing one’s self as “crazy”).</td>

 “In hospital I was treated as though I deserved to be punished. People treat their animals better than many psychiatric patients are treated. Any self-respect I had quickly disappeared.

It has taken me many, many years to regain my sense of self, and to this day I still struggle with the sense of shame and ‘otherness’ this experience created.

The widely-held view that coercive treatment potentially saves lives and protects society is a form of social control that fails to acknowledge the cost and the damage to the individuals concerned.

Peer-run crisis alternatives can operate from a set of assumptions completely different from traditional services. Traditional services focus of finding a diagnosis and treating it (predominantly pharmacologically) whereas crisis alternatives can focus on how people have made meaning out of their experience, building mutually responsible relationships, and creating “new stories.” Peer-run crisis alternatives that are trauma-informed recognize that past trauma (including psychiatric hospitalization) results in a way of seeing and relating that leaves people disconnected, isolated, and shamed, providing an awareness of how people’s individual painful life experiences (physical, sexual and emotional abuse, major loss, disaster, war, forced treatment, etc.) impact every aspect of their lives.</td>

Understanding that the way we see, relate, act and know occurs within the context of our histories, there is no assumption of a ‘problem’, and therefore no need for assessment or evaluation. Instead peers work at developing new ways of communicating their needs and feelings to one another without threat or coercion. For some of us, for example, thinking and speaking of Suicide is a way of dealing with our strong feelings. To be able to talk about what those feelings are (acknowledging that Suicide is not a feeling); when, why and how they arise, and having the option of exploring other ways of expressing them without the threat of hospitalization requires both the willingness to sit with the discomfort on both sides of the conversation, and the courage to negotiate other ways of thinking and talking about it. </td>

Trauma-informed peer support does not assume a diagnosis or a problem. Instead, the focus is on developing relationships that are committed to mutual learning, growth and challenging of one another. The traditional ‘expert-patient’, or ‘helper-helpee’ roles are replaced by the expectation of a mutual relationship involving give and take. Being constantly the receiver of services has meant that many of us have lost much of our sense of having valid and respected roles within our communities. </td>

Crisis alternatives can provide the opportunity to challenge the traditional notions of risk and safety.

Peer crisis alternatives, on the other hand, can offer the safety of trusting relationships that are mutually negotiated.

As well as offering a response to crisis that will listen, validate, explore and challenge old and new ways of making meaning, crisis alternatives can provide the opportunity to develop a ‘pro-active crisis plan or interview’. This is a structured pre-prepared process that can serve as a type of advance directive, as well as being one resource with which to enhance the development of the relationship.

<br>1. What peer support/crisis alternative is and what it’s not (not about treatment, people not seen as ill, but seen as responsible adults trying to learn something).
<br>2. Relationships and the importance of mutual healing (it needs to work both ways, exploring how mutual relationships have been helpful and/or taken our power).
<br>3. Facilitate a non-illness story (building on a person’s subjective experience and language).
<br>4. Thinking “from a distance” (How might someone else describe your difficult experiences)?

Summary of an article written by Dan Hazen 
<br> 
<br>“An ex-patient voice has been let into the oftentimes oppressive psychiatric system to see that the needs of those who are often unheard are heard.  Clearly a milestone has been made through the efforts of a group of people who for years have been stigmatized, discriminated against, abused by the system and otherwise ‘kept down’ or kept quiet by certain factions in society.”  Gloria C. Hale
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy refers to the process or act of a person of equal standing pleading the cause of a person who shares that equal standing.  An example is a lawyer who provides a legal defense for another lawyer.  Another example is a person who has an experience of emotional difficulties or challenges providing advocacy for another person with similar experiences.  
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy was developed to assist persons who are, have been, or might become involved in the psychiatric system.  Peer Advocates speak out so that the individual’s choices and wishes are made clear and respected.    
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy is an innovative and exciting vehicle of empowerment.  Many people experience stigmatization and discrimination as a result of psychiatric labelling.  Peer advocates have a common bond of having received psychiatric treatment.  
<br> 
<br>What is a Peer Advocate: - Peer Advocacy is non-clinical and Peer Advocates are not part of the “mental health system”.
<br> 
<br>A Peer Advocate represents someone else’s interests.  The individual being represented is the person who should define his or her interests – within the bounds of the law and mutual propriety.  The job of the Peer Advocate is to help the individual get as much as possible of what he or she wants and what he or she is legally entitled to.  Peer Advocates inform the individual about the options, assist the person in expressing preferences, and ensure that these preferences are heard and vigorously pursued within the scope of the law.  A Peer Advocate may appear to be in charge, but this should never result in setting the goals for the individual.
<br> 
<br>Peer advocates may accompany the individual to situations such as “treatment team meetings”, discharge planning meeting, medication over objection hearings, and retention hearings in the court system.  (Forced treatment and detention must be stopped under the Convention, but there is still a role for Peer Advocates to ensure that these practices do not return.)  Peer Advocates may monitor court proceedings in a community to address and to report on violations of civil liberties and human rights.
<br> 
<br>Peer Advocacy ensures a practice of reasonable accommodation, supported decision making, and attempts to establish, expand, protect and enforce the human, legal and civil rights of people all people, particularly people engaged by the psychiatric/mental health system.</td>

According to the principles of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, reasonable accommodation must be provided if a person with a psychosocial disability is lawfully detained.  However, reasonable accommodation cannot justify low standards of human rights for all, or the existence of the death penalty, and so we must seek the 
<br>reform of the whole criminal justice system to fully realize reasonable accommodation for persons with psychosocial disabilities.  Furthermore, we support alternatives to incarceration and the discretion to refrain from prosecution where appropriate, so long as these measures do not 
<br>involve compulsory psychiatric treatment.</td>

While we cannot agree with the insanity defense in principle, it needs to be left open as a practical option as long as the death penalty and other harsh measures are being used in the penal system.  We think that all people should be protected from the death penalty and other punishments that cause great harm.  Such protection must not be conditioned on persons with disabilities accepting an inferior status of legal incapacity in the determination of responsibility for crimes.  Therefore we seek abolition of the insanity defense as part of a comprehensive penal reform.  We do not condone compulsory psychiatric detention or treatment for people acquitted by reason of insanity.</td>

• Work with national human rights institutions or new mechanisms that may be set up to monitor the Convention at the national level.  Such mechanisms need to be independent from the government and have control over their own budgets.  They should be composed in a way that reflects all sectors and diverse populations of the country and include people with disabilities (including users and survivors of psychiatry) and be responsive to diverse communities.  Their roles may vary but can include proposing legislation, making recommendations on positive measures for implementation, and in some cases, adjudicating complaints of human rights violations.</td>

Many governments and NGOs would like the Conference of States Parties to be a forum for sharing information and discussing challenges in implementing the Convention.  This is different from the role the Conference of States Parties has played in other human rights treaties, but this type of forum has been done with environmental treaties and other treaties where information-sharing is important.  We do not yet know whether this will be implemented, or when, but user/survivor organizations that are interested in international forums for cooperation of this kind should keep it in mind when making plans and budgets.</td>

NGO reports or “shadow reports” drawing attention to human rights violations or concerns in a country that is reporting to the Committee.

A growing trend is for NGOs in a country to unite in preparing one large report with many sections contributed by different constituencies.  It is not necessary to be a lawyer to do a “shadow report” but NGOs should be able to give references for facts presented and to point to the articles of the Convention that have been violated, or are otherwise relevant.</td>

8) Human Rights Council, created by the UN General Assembly (replaces the former Human Rights Commission).

The Human Rights Council also designates Special Rapporteurs, who are independent experts assigned to look into situations and subject matter of concern to human rights.  For example, there is a Special Rapporteur on Torture, one on Health, one on Education, one on Violence against women.  It is possible that a Special Rapporteur on Disability or the Human Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be designated in the future.  However, at the present time, there is a Special Rapporteur on the Standard Rules on Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities, who is appointed by the Commission on Social Development rather than the Human Rights Council.  NGOs and individuals can submit information to the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council; it is important to check the procedures and use any forms provided so that your information is handled in the best way.  </td>
