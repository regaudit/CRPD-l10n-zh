"TCI Asia (Transforming communities for Inclusion of persons with "
"psychosocial disabilities, Asia) is an independent Asian alliance of "
"organizations and persons with psychosocial disabilities, and cross "
"disability supporters, focussing on Article 19 and its realization in the "
"Asian region. Since 2012, TCI Asia has made several country visits, 4 annual "
"plenary consultative processes, 1 strategy development workshop, conducted "
"research and trainings; and has engaged upto 15 member countries and over "
"100 members, to enhance the pedagogy and practice of Article 19 for the "
"region. On behalf of TCI Asia, Bhargavi Davar presented a paper based on the "
"consultative processes done between 2012-2015 of TCI Asia before the "
"Monitoring Committee of the Convention on the Rights of persons with "
"Disabilities (CRPD) at the Day of General Discussion, towards a General "
"Comment on Article 19."

"“Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close "
"to home - so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the "
"world. Yet they are the world of the individual person; the neighbourhood he "
"lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm, or office "
"where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seeks "
"equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. "
"Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. "
"Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look "
"in vain for progress in the larger world.” \n"

"upon the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1949. "

"The ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with "
"Disabilities has been a watershed moment for persons with psychosocial "
"disabilities, including those from the global south. As stakeholders, we "
"were at the forefront in the negotiations of the Convention, and ensured "
"that the resulting document reflected our hopes and aspirations, thus going "
"beyond mere ‘protection’ of rights. In particular, the drafting of Article "
"19 of the Convention, which spoke of the right to live independently and "
"within the community, was of special relevance. \n"
"All impairments have had the common legacy of being seen from a medical "
"lens, as something that needed a cure, as opposed to being one more aspect "
"of human diversity on the lines of gender, race, sexuality etc. In the case "
"of psychosocial disability, even ‘treatment’ is a space for violation of "
"human rights and dignity. The legacy of colonial rule in countries in the "
"global south has been the regulation of persons with psychosocial "
"disabilities and their properties by way of law – and to even term it as "
"criminalization would not be out of place. After the British crown took over "
"the East India Company in 1858, one of the first legislations enacted were "
"pertaining to asylums for ‘lunatics and idiots’1. In many other countries, "
"there were no mental health legislations, though in practice persons with "
"mental health impairments have been kept in asylums and administered forced "
"treatment under restraint. "

"The Global call for Mental Health Legislation\n"
"At the international human rights level, the need to protect the rights of "
"persons with mental health impairments was seen as an important area of "
"intervention for decades. In 1978, the general assembly had called upon the "
"commission on human rights to urge the subcommission on prevention of "
"discrimination and protection of minorities to formulate guidelines towards "
"the protection of those detained on the grounds of mental impairments2. This "
"effort took over 10 years, with the final “Principles for the Protection of "
"Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Health Care” "
"being adopted in 19913. \n"
"The principles speak of rights of persons with mental illness, however "
"throughout the document it lays down deviations from these and other "
"established human rights, “in accordance with domestic law”. The principles "
"lay down regulations for involuntary treatment and deprivation of liberty, "
"including procedural safeguards. The principles, however, extended only to "
"persons who had been admitted in a mental health facility, and so the same "
"did not touch upon their rights elsewhere. \n"
"Principle 23 mandated that “States should implement the present Principles "
"through appropriate legislative, judicial, administrative, educational and "
"other measures, which they shall review periodically,” which was, in effect, "
"the first call for mental health legislation. Towards fulfilment of this, "
"the World Health Organization, in 2005, issued the WHO Resource Book on "
"Mental Health, Human Rights and Legislation4, towards assisting states "
"towards drafting their own mental health legislation where the same did not "
"exist previously. \n"
"The very next year brought about the adoption of the UN Convention on the "
"Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which offered a complete change in "
"rights based approaches towards persons with psychosocial disabilities. The "
"following table enlists a few of these changes vis-a-vis the WHO Resource "
"Book.\n"
