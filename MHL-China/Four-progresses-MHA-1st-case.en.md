Some background information:  
> The plaintiff of the first case in Mental Health Law of China, Xu Wei, is a
man who has been committed to psychiatric hospital and institutions for about
14 years (from 2002 to 2017). When Mental Health Law was enacted in May of
2013, Xu Wei was able to ask for dischargement with the assistance of lawyer
Yang and a dedicated NGO. Even though the MHL set explicitly the patient's
right to sue as well as their right to discharge by themselves (in the
situation of no dangerousness), the persons with psychosocial(mental)
disabilities can still be entitled as incapacitated or limited capacitated
before the law. This is mainly regulated in civil laws of China. Thus, Xu Wei
and lawyer Yang started their five-year long journey to fight for his right to
discharge.

Lawyer Yang's reflection: 

**First progress**, was the enforcement of Shanghai Mental Health Ordinance in 2002
(Xu lives in Shanghai). At that time Xu had been living in the mental health
center in Putuo District, Shanghai for one year. It seemed that there's little
hope of dischargement for him.  

Fortunately, there was a first of its kind of mental health (local) regulation
had been released in Shanghai in the same year, April the 7th. It breakingly
set up a mechanism of diagnosis, hospitalization, forensics and rehabilitation
for "psychiatric patients"in mental health services based on a psyhchiatric concept of
"insight" as a core of its mechanism.  

From the perspectives today, it was problematic for this regulation to introduce this psychiatric
concept into the law/regulation area, as well as its article which said:
"patients' rights to informed consent and decision-making should only be valid
under the premise that he or she has insight." (article 36) However, this
regulation had also clarified explicitly that "psychiatric patients"'s rights
should be protected. It said: "medical institutions should approve the request
to discharge by patients who has insight." (article 33)   

Under this circumstance, Xu received a notice from his institution telling him
that he can be discharged one day. And then he went home by himself. 

<hr>
**Second progress**, was the enactment of Mental Health Law of China (markably
its Article 82), on May 1st, 2013.  

By then, Xu had been hospitalized in an private institution called Shanghai Qingchun
institution for mental rehabilitation for ten years. In ten years time, he had
tried various ways to leave the institution, such as run-away, and a law suit
for changing his guardianship. But all of them failed. It seemed that the
possibility to fly over the wall of the institution became harder and harder!  

Another fortune came to him. The first Mental Health Law of China went into
force in that year. Its Article 82 said: "patient with mental
disability/disorder or his/her guardian or close relatives can initiate a litigation if he/she thinks
his/her rights are violated according to this law by administrative, medical
or other parties." This article parallels the three subjects which explicitly
shows that persons with mental disability/disorder have the right to sue.
Although there was no any laws or regulations that deny the right to access to
justice of the persons with mental disability/disorder, it was a significant
milestone that their right to sue had been explicitly declared as the first in
Chinese laws.  

By far, as we all know, persons with psychosocial disabilities still
face the difficulty of access to litigation. Though our friends with
psychosocial disabilities should take advantage of the Article 82 which will
be really useful. Xu Wei had been able to sue on the first day of the
enactment of Mental Health Law, just because of this article. After that, it
had been seven month later that his case was accepted by the court. I (lawyer
Yang) had been explained so much to the court during that time. According to
the Article 82, the right to sue of the persons with disability/disorder is
assured and can not be deprived by the court. As for the right to proxy, the
guardian as a defendant should not be the guardian/proxy of the plaintiff in the
same case - according to the principles of the right of proxy in Civil Rules
of China. The court sould recognize the plaintiff's right of choosing a lawyer to
represent him/her according to his/her pure income behavior. I knew that the
court would not have such patience to deal with my case without the Article
82, even though I myself was knowledgable enough on this (and so was the
court).  

<hr>

**Third progress**, was the amendment of Shanghai Mental Health Ordinance in
March 1st, 2015 (esp. Article 41).  

When time flies to 2015, Xu had failed the first court trial of this case (first case in
Mental Health Law), and he began the procedure of appealing. I (lawyer Yang)
and Xu did not feel optimistic about its result. My opinions were stated on my
statement for appealing: "There are two focal points of this case: for one,
is apellant's behavior danger to himself and/or others? for the other, does
the apellant have the right as well as the capacity/ability to discharge by himself?" For the first point, I
argued that the apellee had mixed up with the concepts of dangerousness and
probability; for the second point, the Article 45 of Mental Health Law already
states that "For psychiatric patients who are to be discharged, if they had no
capacity/ability to do that, their guardians should take the procedure of
dischargement for them". This implies that the psychiatric patients can take
the procedure of dischargement by themselves, as long as they have the ability
to do that.  

As for this implication, there was already a law which is the just amended
Shanghai Mental Health Ordinance on my back. This local regulation had
inititated its amendment right after the enactment of Mental Health Law. On
March 1st 2015, the updated version went into force. It explicitly states the
logic that the Article 45 of Mental Health Law implies. It refines the logic
as: "In-patient psychiatric patients who meet the condition of dischargement,
should take their procedure for discharge in time. The patients can take the
procedure for discharge by themselves as well as by their guardians; Patients
who have no ability to take the procedure for discharge, their guardians
should take that procedure for them."  

However, unfortunately, the second trial failed mistakenly again. The court
utilized the General Civil Law over Mental Health Law. But I still feel
confident since the amended Shanghai Mental Health Ordinance definitely
strengthens my arguement. 

<hr>

**Forth progress**, is the enactment of the General Principles of Civil Law
(民法总则) on October 1st, 2017 (especially the Article 24).  

The time flies to the first half of 2016, the first case of Mental Health Law
has gone through its first trial, second trial, retrial and the application
for counterappeal, whereas we failed in all these processes. But Xu Wei did
not give up, and tried to apply the psychiatric forensics for the third time.
He was then very determined and said that if this try went failure again, he
will stop his life. I, as his legal-aid lawyer, was deeply moved and
encouraged by him. I tried again and again to negotiate with the local court
(Putuo District, where Xu's household registered), trying to put this case on
record in order to apply for a psychiatric forensics, with a suitable cause of
action. The process lasted about half a year. We used three possible causes of
action. One of them was that Xu himself applies for a declaration of fully capacitated
person to him. But the court rejected it with an incredible reason. (see the
photo)  

![The reply from the Court of Putuo District](https://github.com/regaudit/CRPD-l10n-zh/blob/master/MHL-China/putuo-ywh.jpeg)  

The logic on the reply from the Court of Putuo District can be concluded as: 
the court can not declare that Xu is a person of capacity because 
the previous (2012) verdict of the case related to Xu can not be considered as
**a verdict that declears you (Xu) were/are a person of incapacity or limited
capacity**. Although the previous verdict _de facto_ recognized that Xu was a
person of capacity,  the cause of action of that case was to change his
guardian but not to declare his capacity. Therefore the court alleged they
have no privilege to do that (and also Xu cannot provide other verdict which
declares he is a person of capacity). 

Such logic sounds reasonable, from the perspective of those judges who adopt
"ostrich policy" to their cases. The previous (unamended) 
Civil Law (民法通则) regulated that the stakholders of the psychiatric
patient can apply for declaration that the patient is a person of incapacity
or limited capacity before the court. The person who was declared as
incapacitated or limited capacitated, can by himself/herself or by
stakeholders apply for declaration that he/she is a person of limited capacity
or full capacity before the court. Article 187 and 190 of Civil Procedure Law
also state the procedure of the declaration of capacity/incapacity.  

However, problematically, there are massive persons with psychosocial
disabilities and persons with intellectual/learning disabilities being treated
as persons of limited capacity (or persons of incapacity) in front of various
organizations/institutions by various reasons, not declared by the court. Mr.
Xu is the case. He had been treated as limited capacitated person by the local
hospital for ten years before he received the judgement of declaring him a
limited capacitated person by Putuo District Court in 2012. During this ten
years he had been designated a guardian by the local authority (居委会). And
during this ten years he had been isolated within the wall of a private mental
institution for "rehabilitation", with his liberty fully deprived.  

So the tricky thing is, according to the logic of Putuo District Court, what
on earth capacity does Xu have? Is he a **legitimate** limited capacitated
person, or is he still a capacitated person since no legal procedure has
declared that he is not? Now the society/community will not recognize his
capacity in fact, and how will he find ways to **resume** his personhood about
capacity which has been somehow lost?  

You know what, the court will not think of such things. We had to change to
the third cause to action (which was that we represented Xu's mother to apply
for disable her guardianship to the court). The court finally accepted the
case. Thus Xu was able to apply for his third psychiatric forensics. And God
blessed, we received the result of the forensics which recognized Xu's full
capacitated personhood. Therefore, there was no need to take the action to
disable his guardianship. We then asked the court to declare that Xu was a
person of full capacity with this forensics result as an evidence. But there
was still the old dilemma: Why and how would the court declare Xu was fully
capacitated while nobody had declared that he was not?  

Let's not worry, at last! The amended General Principles of Civil Law
(民法总则) helps us. Its Article 24 changes the term "declare" (in Article 19
of Civil Law) to "recognize" when it comes to state the procedure of judging a
person's capacity. This indicates that the declaration of incapacity is not
the premise of the declaration of capacity. The court can recognize the
person's capacity based only at any explicitly or implicitly stated
recognition of the person's incapacity in previous judgements. According to
this change, Putuo District Court had to made the judgement of declaring Xu's full
capacity on October, while it accepted our application as early as on August this
year.  

Till now, the first case of Mental Health Law has been finished. Mr. Xu can
start his brand new life freely along with his girlfriend (who has also been
cimmitted to the same mental institution for many years).
