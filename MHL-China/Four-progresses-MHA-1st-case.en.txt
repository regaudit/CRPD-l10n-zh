Some background information:  
> The plaintiff of the first case in Mental Health Law of China, Xu Wei, is a
man who has been committed to psychiatric hospital and institutions for about
14 years (from 2002 to 2017). When Mental Health Law was enacted in May of
2013, Xu Wei was able to ask for dischargement with the assistance of lawyer
Yang and a dedicated NGO. Even though the MHL set explicitly the patient's
right to sue as well as their right to discharge by themselves (in the
situation of no dangerousness), the persons with psychosocial(mental)
disabilities can still be entitled as incapacitated or limited capacitated
before the law. This is mainly regulated in civil laws of China. Thus, Xu Wei
and lawyer Yang started their five-year long journey to fight for his right to
discharge.

Lawyer Yang's reflection: 

**First progress**, was the enforcement of Shanghai Mental Health Ordinance in 2002
(Xu lives in Shanghai). At that time Xu had been living in the mental health
center in Putuo District, Shanghai for one year. It seemed that there's little
hope of dischargement for him.  

Fortunately, there was a first of its kind of mental health (local) regulation
had been released in Shanghai in the same year, April the 7th. It breakingly
set up a mechanism of diagnosis, hospitalization, forensics and rehabilitation
for "psychiatric patients"in mental health services based on a psyhchiatric concept of
"insight" as a core of its mechanism.  

From the perspectives today, it was problematic for this regulation to introduce this psychiatric
concept into the law/regulation area, as well as its article which said:
"patients' rights to informed consent and decision-making should only be valid
under the premise that he or she has insight." (article 36) However, this
regulation had also clarified explicitly that "psychiatric patients"'s rights
should be protected. It said: "medical institutions should approve the request
to discharge by patients who has insight." (article 33)   

Under this circumstance, Xu received a notice from his institution telling him
that he can be discharged one day. And then he went home by himself. 

<hr>
**Second progress**, was the enactment of Mental Health Law of China (markably
its Article 82), on May 1st, 2013.  

By then, Xu had been hospitalized in an private institution called Shanghai Qingchun
institution for mental rehabilitation for ten years. In ten years time, he had
tried various ways to leave the institution, such as run-away, and a law suit
for changing his guardianship. But all of them failed. It seemed that the
possibility to fly over the wall of the institution became harder and harder!  

Another fortune came to him. The first Mental Health Law of China went into
force in that year. Its Article 82 said: "patient with mental
disability/disorder or his/her guardian or close relatives can initiate a litigation if he/she thinks
his/her rights are violated according to this law by administrative, medical
or other parties." This article parallels the three subjects which explicitly
shows that persons with mental disability/disorder have the right to sue.
Although there was no any laws or regulations that deny the right to access to
justice of the persons with mental disability/disorder, it was a significant
milestone that their right to sue had been explicitly declared as the first in
Chinese laws.  

By far, as we all know, persons with psychosocial disabilities still
face the difficulty of access to litigation. Though our friends with
psychosocial disabilities should take advantage of the Article 82 which will
be really useful. Xu Wei had been able to sue on the first day of the
enactment of Mental Health Law, just because of this article. After that, it
had been seven month later that his case was accepted by the court. I (lawyer
Yang) had been explained so much to the court during that time. According to
the Article 82, the right to sue of the persons with disability/disorder is
assured and can not be deprived by the court. As for the right to proxy, the
guardian as a defendant should not be the guardian/proxy of the plaintiff in the
same case - according to the principles of the right of proxy in Civil Rules
of China. The court sould recognize the plaintiff's right of choosing a lawyer to
represent him/her according to his/her pure income behavior. I knew that the
court would not have such patience to deal with my case without the Article
82, even though I myself was knowledgable enough on this (and so was the
court).
